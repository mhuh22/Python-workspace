For a game as big as this, that gets tons of money and updates all the time, they seem to never actually fix the problems. There's ALWAYS a problem. Random white and black screens that freeze the game, random crashes, delayed ball throwing animations, constantly signing me out, etc. All of these happen multiple times on the daily.",1,2,0.377.1,2025-11-13 20:22:51,420,2025-11-13
